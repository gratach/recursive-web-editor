# Recursive Web Editor

A simple HTML editor that lives in a single HTML file. The editor can be used to edit itself and can create a rendered version of the edited content. It is also possible to export the changes to a new HTML file.

A live version of the editor can be found at [https://pa.trickrichter.de/recursive-web-editor.html](https://pa.trickrichter.de/recursive-web-editor.html).
